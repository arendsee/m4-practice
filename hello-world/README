My hello-world script will replace the string "hello" with "goodbye"

The default invokation of m4 is as a shell command. I do not like this.
I would much prefer to write my commands into a script. No doubt there is
a way to do this, but I have not yet found it.

The hello-world.sh script is a Bash script that calls m4.
